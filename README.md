# Demo for yarn including .git folder with `yarn pack`

It includes empty `.git` folder in the `.tgz` file.

I would expect following to work (include only package.json, README.md and lib directory with all subfiles):

    "files": [
        "lib",
        "README.md"
    ]

But unfortunately it doesn't (it also includes lib and README.md from all packages in node_modules/). The best I was able to get is:


    "files": [
        "/lib/*",
        "/README.md",
        "/package.json"
    ]

But it includes empty `.git` directory and `.gitignore` for some reason...

See output below:

    $ yarn pack && tar xzvf yarn-git-v1.0.0.tgz
    yarn pack v0.17.3
    success Wrote tarball to "/Users/devoto13/Projects/yarn-git/yarn-git-v1.0.0.tgz".
